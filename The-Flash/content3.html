        <h6>A Brightest Day tie-in! Get in on the ground floor of DC's next epic in the making! The Flash races out of Blackest Night and into his own monthly title as the all-new adventures of The Fastest Man Alive start with “Case One: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues!” Barry Allen runs back to his life in Central City, but when one of the Rogues turns up murdered under mysterious circumstances, it's up to The Flash to not only solve this bizarre crime, but protect those that are still targeted by the elusive killer.</h6>
